# The Pond | CS546 F21 Final Project
The purpose of this website is to provide students with an open forum to start discussions based on their coursework or start general conversations with other students. Students are enabled to start threads, reply to other students, and socialize with each other. This will enable greater communication in a centralized and moderated environment for the student body.

## Frameworks We Use

### Vue.js
https://v3.vuejs.org/
It is a **Progressive JavaScript Framework** for building user interfaces, similar to React.js. Itâ€™s based on MVVM mode and uses **virtual DOM** to implement partial updates of the real DOM to improve website rendering efficiency. Plus, the Vue syntax brings excellent convenience to the development.


### Element Plus
https://element-plus.org/en-US/
A library of **UI components** based on Vue provides various components that can be used in the HTML, making the page more friendly and good-looking.
